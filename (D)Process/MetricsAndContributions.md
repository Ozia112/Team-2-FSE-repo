* Isaac’s request to Paola: remove 10 active 10 as it is not in the design.
* Isaac’s request to Paola: reference design for clarification.
* Isaac’s request to Paola: check if removing the color change is appropriate (Isaac asked Paola to review whether the color change from white to black looks good).

* Isaac requested Paola to remove the "sign-up" requirement.
* Isaac requested Paola to create another design for the functional requirement tasks and activity management:
    - Regarding this: "The student wants to view and manage all their tasks from different applications in a consolidated list in UADY HUB, in order to have complete control over what needs to be done."**
