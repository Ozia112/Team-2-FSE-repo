#### Binnacle Creation Guidelines :shipit:

Each department must create its respective binnacle, ensuring the following points are covered:
1.	Record time and duration:

- Log the time spent and the duration of specific tasks.
2.	Personal log changes:

- Report any changes made in a personal log, stored in the folder where the assigned activity is located.
- The file name must follow this structure: [.] Team ID [_] Binnacle.

3.	Activity Reports:

 - Each report must include the following information:

      - Sprint number

      - Department

   - Activity ID

   - Description of changes or tasks completed

You need to create the binnacle in your respective department's folder. Once you finish the binnacle, you must submit a pull request to my department (Binnacles/Changelogs) for review.
