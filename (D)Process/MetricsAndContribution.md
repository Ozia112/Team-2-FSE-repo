## Project Stage Participation Breakdown
- To calculate the participation percentage, the total weight of the activities in the delivery was summed up and a rule of three was applied.
- For the variance, a subtraction is made with respect to the previous delivery.
- For the compound percentage, that is, the total project participation percentage, a rule of three was applied based on the maximum participation percentage.
