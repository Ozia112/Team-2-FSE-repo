# Monitoring Tools  

## Introduction  
During the third week, the workflow of all team members was monitored using the backlog provided by GitHub's project section. Department heads created and defined tasks for their respective teams.  

To organize and monitor project activities, various fields were established to ensure proper task division and assignment.  

## Defined Fields  

### Status  
The status of each task is classified into five main categories:  
- **Backlog:** Includes all tasks, regardless of their scheduled due date.  
- **To Do:** Tasks that need to be worked on during the sprint.  
- **In Process:** Tasks that are currently in progress.  
- **Review:** Completed tasks requiring review by the department head or repository administrator.  
- **Done:** Tasks that are completed and approved.  

### Priority  
Tasks were divided based on their priority level:  
- **High:** Critical for project progress. Delays in these tasks directly impact overall delivery.  
- **Medium:** Important, but do not immediately block other activities.  
- **Low:** Can be completed later and do not affect the progress of other tasks.  

### Size  
The size of tasks was defined based on their scope and estimated completion time:  
- **Epic:** Complex, group-level activities such as logs. These do not grant individual points as they are part of mandatory protocols.  
- **3:** Department management activities, such as task creation, review, and pull request approval.  
- **2:** Large, complex tasks requiring more execution time.  
- **1:** Small, quick tasks that are easy to complete.  

### Department  
This field categorized activities based on their area of responsibility:  
- **Product/Requirements**  
- **Processes**  
- **Design**  
- **Video/Presentation**  
- **Competencies**  
- **Logs/Changelogs**  

### Sprint  
This field assigned tasks to the corresponding sprint:  
- **Sprint 1**  
- **Sprint 2**  
- **Sprint 3**  

## Logging and Monitoring  
Audio recordings were made during weekly meetings to document decisions and project progress. Additionally, the number of completed tasks and their size were evaluated in relation to the overall project.  

Task weighting was determined by department heads, considering their importance and the effort required.  

## Individual Participation  
Task assignment was dynamic. Each team member selected the activities they wanted to work on, self-assigning them. If a task was not completed correctly within the stipulated time, its correction and subsequent delivery were reassigned to another member, who also earned the corresponding participation points.
