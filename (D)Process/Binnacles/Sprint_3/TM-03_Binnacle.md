Add Platform Interface
>- In this activity, the components were created to generate an interface where the user has a text box where they will enter the link of their course or platform so that it can be added to the AUDY Hub. Likewise, a section is also considered in the same interface where they can see their currently active courses. All this with the purpose of covering the functional requirement of adding a platform, now in a complete interface.
