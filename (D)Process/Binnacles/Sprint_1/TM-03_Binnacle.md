Created Task Assignment
>- All tasks to be performed by both the Product Department and the Requirements Department have been created. Each task was assigned attributes such as weight, priority, delivery date, and other elements. The most notable of these is the task description, which ensures that any team member can understand and execute the task by simply reading the description.

(B4.0) Feasibility Study
>- In the process of the activity, I conducted a thorough analysis of the project, considering factors like available resources, estimated budget, and potential risks. I then developed a feasibility study, covering everything from project objectives to technical requirements. I also evaluated the time needed for completion, factoring in the team's experience and limitations. Finally, I created a structured Markdown document summarizing all the information and conclusions gathered throughout the process.

(C1.0) Requirements Evolution
>- In the process of evolving the requirements, both functional and non-functional requirements were reduced to simplify the scope and improve development feasibility. Functional requirements were reduced from 8 to 3, combining and eliminating key elements. Non-functional requirements were consolidated into broader categories, such as "Visual Consistency and Accessibility" and "Ease of Use," removing those deemed non-essential. This optimization ensures a more focused and efficient development process.

(G3.0) Matching Requirements
>- Taking into account the functional requirements already defined in the departments folder, I added them to the document along with a brief description that explains their function. Additionally, an image was included to validate each requirement, assigning an "Accepted" or "Correct" value for this criterion.

(G3.0) G3.1 Matching Artefacts
>- With the requirements refined and detailed, the prototype was created to validate the functional requirements. In this activity, I only added the description of the task and then included the link that takes the user directly to the matching of the artifacts, which is the verification of the user stories in action.

(C3.0) Final Non Functional Requirements
>- In this activity, the number of non-functional requirements was reduced by focusing on the most essential and relevant ones. Additionally, their descriptions, user stories, and acceptance criteria were specified in greater detail. This helps ensure that user needs are clear and that the platform's development meets precise expectations, facilitating an optimal experience.
