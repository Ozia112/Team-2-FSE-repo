# Feasibility Study for UADY HUB Project

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to provide students at the Faculty of Mathematics, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY), with an integrated solution to manage and organize access to various academic platforms. Currently, students face difficulties accessing platforms such as "En Línea", "UADY Virtual", and "Unidad Académica de Educación Virtual". This project aims to centralize these platforms into one interface, improving organization and efficiency while ensuring that important information is not lost.

## Available Resources

The project team consists of seven members, with one member having experience in Python programming. The rest of the team has skills in design and other disciplines, which provides a broad range of perspectives. While not all members have experience in software development, they are highly motivated and eager to learn. In terms of resources, the team has the necessary tools for development, though the infrastructure is somewhat variable. Some members have the proper devices to handle the project’s tools, but others may experience limitations in terms of hardware.

## Estimated Budget

The estimated budget for the project is approximately 7,000 Mexican pesos. This budget would cover the purchase of necessary software licenses and the possible hiring of external services, such as consulting or technical support, if required during certain phases of the project.

## Estimated Timeline

The project is expected to take between 4 to 6 months for completion. This timeline takes into account the limited experience of some team members and the additional time constraints caused by academic and work-related responsibilities. While the lack of experience could cause delays in the initial phases, the team believes there is enough time to complete the project, allowing for learning and integration of the platforms.

## Market Analysis

There are similar projects within the UADY aimed at managing academic platforms, but this project distinguishes itself by offering the integration of various platforms into a single interface without requiring separate profiles for each. The target audience is undergraduate students from the Faculty of Mathematics at UADY, who struggle with managing multiple platforms. This solution is expected to significantly improve students' ability to manage their academic activities and personal organization.

## Technical Requirements

The project will utilize a variety of programming languages and tools, including Python, MySQL, C++, Java, HTML, PHP, and platforms such as Jupyter Notebook. The system must be compatible with a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers, and it must function on both Android and iOS operating systems. This ensures that students can access the platform from any device of their choice.

## Identified Risks

Several risks have been identified that could impact the development of the project. The lack of technical experience among some team members is a significant challenge, potentially delaying progress in the initial phases. Additionally, time constraints due to academic and work obligations may affect the overall timeline. Another major risk is the infrastructure, as some team members may not have devices powerful enough to run the necessary tools, leading to delays and potential difficulties during development.
