## Conclusion

Users of the application share the need to centralize the various academic platforms in one place, to improve organization and avoid wasting time. Primary users, first-semester Software Engineering students, seek to organize and receive notifications about their courses, facing difficulties with the variety of platforms; they have an intermediate technological level. Secondary users, high school students, want to become familiar with university tools, but their technological level is basic and they face confusion about their use. On the other hand, potential users, students in advanced semesters, need to centralize resources and prevent forgetfulness, having advanced technological skills. Although they have different backgrounds and skills, they all agree on the frustration due to the lack of integration of the platforms and seek efficient solutions.
