# Product Evolution  
## Summary of Changes  

### Changes:  
These are the changes made during the first, second, and third iterations:  

- **Functional Requirements:** The functional requirements were reduced from 17 in the first iteration to 8 in the second, and now, in this latest iteration, they have been streamlined to just 3, combining 3 requirements into 1.  

  Functional requirements removed in the third iteration:  
  - Language change  

  Functional requirements combined in the third iteration:  
  - Notifications  
  - Platform status  

  **Combination:** Notifications and Platform Status were integrated into the Activity Bar.  
  **Elimination:** The Language Change feature was removed due to its low priority and relevance for this iteration.  
  **Redefinition:** Task and Activity Management was consolidated as part of the Activity Bar.

- **Non-functional Requirements:** The non-functional requirements were reduced from 15 in the first iteration to 14 in the second iteration by modifying and removing some, and now, in the third iteration, they have been streamlined to just 2 by combining 3 requirements into 1.  

  Non-functional requirements removed in the third iteration:  
  - Multilingual support  
  - Display options  

  Non-functional requirements combined in the third iteration:  
  - Visual consistency  
  - Visual accessibility  
  - Readable text style  

  **Combination:** Visual Consistency, Visual Accessibility, and Readable Text Style were merged into a single requirement called **Visual Consistency and Accessibility.**  
  **Elimination:** Multilingual Support and Display Options were considered secondary and were removed.

- **Priority Levels:**  
  - The same priority levels from the first iteration were used in the second.  
  - In the third iteration, priority levels were no longer considered as all requirements were of high priority.  

- **User Definition:**  
  - The user definition from the first iteration remained the same in the second.  
  - In the third iteration, a document was created describing the primary, secondary, and potential users of the application.  
  - The provided information seeks to humanize the users by creating realistic profiles, aiming to understand their needs, frustrations, and usage contexts.

- **Value Proposition:**  
  - The value proposition remained unchanged in the second iteration and was the same as in the first.  
  - In the third iteration, the value proposition was not used; instead, it was applied in the feasibility study for the project.  

- **Product Description:**  
  - The product description from the first iteration remained unchanged in the second.  
  - In the third iteration, the product description was not used and was instead incorporated into the feasibility study.  

- **Use Case Diagrams:**  
  - The use case diagram from the first iteration was not modified in the second.  
  - In the third iteration, a new diagram was created for each requirement, replacing the one from the second iteration.

- **Process Description:**  
  - The process description from the first iteration was modified in the second.  
  - In this iteration, the process description was updated further.

- **User Interfaces:**  
  - User interfaces were introduced in the second iteration.  
  - In the third iteration, the interfaces were improved based on the final requirements.  
  - The third iteration included an evolution of the user interface.
