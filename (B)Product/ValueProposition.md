>># Value Proposition  
> At the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán (UADY), different platforms are used, each hosted separately. Some of these platforms include:

 >>## En Línea
> This platform hosts virtual classrooms for some subjects taught by different professors at UADY. 
> Students can view the courses they are enrolled in and access assignments, grades, announcements, messages, etc.

>>## UADY Virtual  
> This platform is similar to 'En Línea' but includes additional features, such as links to other platforms, including SICEI, the Virtual Library, Institutional Email, etc.

>>## Unidad Académica de Educación Virtual
> Like the previous platforms, this one is for courses, but it is more oriented toward 100% remote education without the need for attending a physical classroom.

>> # Similarity
> All three platforms are powered by Moodle, a learning platform for teachers and students used for e-learning.

>> # Difference  
> Moodle is a tool that facilitates distance education for teachers and students, either asynchronously or synchronously. It offers both a web version and a mobile app, through which students can view their enrolled courses. In this case, the app version has a feature that allows users to add different platforms like En Línea, UADY Virtual, and the Unidad Académica de Educación Virtual, but as separate profiles. This product will share the feature of adding different UADY platforms, but without the need for separate profiles.

>># Value
> This project aims to help all students of our faculty by providing a space to manage and organize all UADY platforms. It will address students' need to keep their various sites organized.
