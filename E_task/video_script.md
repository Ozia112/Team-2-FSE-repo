Let's imagine Sam, a UADY student who has lost quite a few points in some of his subjects. ‚Å†Sam forgets all the links where he has to upload his assignments and, since he can't find them in time, he can't turn them in. In addition, sometimes he goes to classes when there are no classes, since he does not receive notifications. This is a situation that many students face daily, and it is precisely the problem we want to solve with our application.

Nice to meet you, we are Team 2 and we are working on the development of an application called "UADYHUB". Our main objective is to create a platform that consolidates most of the university pages and resources in one place, to facilitate access and improve the comfort of students.

In this first phase of the project, we have focused on creating a sketch that reflects how the application will look and function. To carry out this first stage, we have equally divided the tasks, addressing areas such as product description, definition of users and clients, value proposition, functional and non-functional requirements, priority levels, use case diagram, description of the process, contribution metrics, presentation and editing of the video, in addition to generic and specific competencies.

Throughout this month, we have held several meetings at different times, both before and after school, to collectively advance the project. Each member of the team has contributed according to their abilities, dividing tasks to optimize time and effort.
Despite this division, we have all worked collaboratively and supported each other every step of the way.

Our leader, Isaac, has been key in the organization and advancement of the project. He has guided us through the activities and taught us how to use GitHub, a tool that has allowed us to collaborate more efficiently by uploading and managing our contributions. Little by little, we have been integrating our parts of the project into this platform, which has facilitated our progress.

We are moving forward steadily and committedly in this initial phase and will continue working together to make "UADYHUB" a reality that benefits the entire student community. We appreciate your attention and are excited for what is to come in the next stages of the project.
