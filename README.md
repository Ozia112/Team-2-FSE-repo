# FIS Project Stage 1 (Place holder name: *UADY HUB*)
## Introduction
>The project consists of the [**proposal**][Product] of a software product that serves as a potential solution to a social issue in the environment. It should be able to facilitate certain aspects for the [**target users**][Definition of users/clients] we have in mind when defining the product proposal.
## Second Stage
### Product Definition
>The first stage of the project involves defining the proposed product through a general description, identifying the target user and the client, as well as comparing it with other products that may offer similar solutions to ours. Additionally, it aims to create a strong distinction between the alternatives and our product through its value proposition.
### Definition of functional and non-functional requirements.
>During the first stage of the project, it is also necessary to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the product. All of this is important for the proper documentation of the development, so that later well-structured prototypes can be created, allowing a clear understanding of how the product would function.
### Documentation and production of the video
>The project must be well documented through the GitHub repository so that in case you need to consult any aspect of the product, it can be reviewed at any time and have a clear overview of all aspects of its development.
>You will also need documents that explain the development of the product from the developer's point of view to create a working context and facilitate processes later.
>We will also need to create a summary/documentary video that encompasses the most important aspects of the first stage of the project, with a script that is clear and with a pleasant rhythm for the viewer. In addition to multimedia content that accompanies the video and graphically illustrates its documentary intention.
