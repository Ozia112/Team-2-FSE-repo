## Third Stage

### Product Evoltion
In this third delivery, we will present the results of the final list of requirements, as well as the usability tests. 

### Final of Functional and Non-Functional Requirement
With the help of the functional and non-functional requirements created in the first delivery, and later evaluated in the second delivery, we refined our focus on the requirements critical to the platform's functionality. Non-functional requirements were also reviewed to correct errors that were overlooked in the first delivery.
Using the information gathered from the first and second deliveries, we were able to finalize the list of functional and non-functional requirements.

### Documentation and production of the video
The project must be well documented through the GitHub repository so that in case you need to consult any aspect of the product, it can be reviewed at any time and have a clear overview of all aspects of its development. We will also need documents that explain the development of the product from the developer's point of view to create a working context and facilitate processes later. We will also need to create a summary/documentary video that encompasses the most important aspects of the second stage of the project, with a script that is clear and with a pleasant rhythm for the viewer. In addition to multimedia content that accompanies the video and graphically illustrates its documentary intention.
