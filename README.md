# FIS Project Stage 2 (UADY HUB)
## Introduction
>The project consists of the [**proposal**][Product] of a software product that serves as a potential solution to a social issue in the environment. It should be able to facilitate certain aspects for the [**target users**][Definition of users/clients] we have in mind when defining the product proposal.
Throughout this month, the proposal evolves to a product that might help and resolve problems found in situations that some new students at the Autonomous University of Yucatan (UADY) can face. These students often struggle with remembering and constantly checking the various online courses platforms that the university offers. Currently, the potential user group is limited to the Faculty of Mathematics.

## Second Stage
### Product Evolution
>In this second delivery, changes were made compared to the first, which were then evaluated and compared to more precisely identify when began the project increment between September and October.
#### Definition of functional and non-functional requirements.
>During the first stage of the project, it is also necessary to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the product. All of this is important for the proper documentation of the development, so that later well-structured prototypes can be created, allowing a clear understanding of how the product would function.
>Initially, the functional requirements were reviewed again to determine which were essential and which should be eliminated, allowing us to focus more precisely on those fundamental to the platformâ€™s operation. Similarly, the non-functional requirements were reviewed to correct possible errors not found in the first delivery due to the lack of information and researched feedback. 
#### UI Design
>As part of the requirements for the second delivery, high fidelity UI proposals was developed to effectively validate the functional requirements of UADY HUB, in other words, to assure that can be located in the interface(evidence).
#### Documentation and production of the video
>The project must be well documented through the GitHub repository so that in case you need to consult any aspect of the product, it can be reviewed at any time and have a clear overview of all aspects of its development.
>We will also need documents that explain the development of the product from the developer's point of view to create a working context and facilitate processes later.
>We will also need to create a summary/documentary video that encompasses the most important aspects of the second stage of the project, with a script that is clear and with a pleasant rhythm for the viewer. In addition to multimedia content that accompanies the video and graphically illustrates its documentary intention.
