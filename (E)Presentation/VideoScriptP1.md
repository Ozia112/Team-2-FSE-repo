## Introduction

The Uady student has had constant problems with the organization of his academic platforms. Every time you have to upload an assignment or review class material, you find yourself searching between different sites: one to upload assignments, another to review your schedule, and several more to receive notifications or access resources. Therefore, they become stressed and affect their performance. “I'm already fed up,” they say. “Every week I forget at least one link”, “I don't upload the assignment on time or I get confused with the dates”. “This has cost me points in some subjects.” Experiences of Uady students, despite their good intentions, this problem continues to affect their performance and lower their average.

## Welcome

Hello again, we are team 2 and we are back for the continuity of “Uadyhub”, now we are entering phase 2 where we will continue developing our platform and improving its functionality. with the same organization and effort as always

## Process
This was the process we carried out for this second phase:

- Task management and charts: We use visual tools to manage and monitor team tasks. This includes backlog boards, tasks in progress, and fulfillment timelines. Each team member was assigned clear tasks with defined deadlines to ensure structured progress.

- New task list: We created a task list for this phase of the project, where each activity had start and delivery dates. This allowed for more efficient control of work

- Security protocols:
In this phase, we implement new security protocols to protect the integrity of the platform and user data. This section will include a detailed explanation of the measures taken and how they address the security issues found in the previous phase.

- Project registration and meetings: 
Links were provided to the project log, where we keep detailed track of the progress of each task. Additionally, an explanation of our regular meetings was included, in which we established work schedules to ensure that the project progressed smoothly.

## Product
The objective of our “Uadyhub” project is to make it easier for students to manage the various academic platforms offered by the faculty, helping them organize their activities more efficiently. We seek the product to integrate at least two university platforms into one, allowing users to easily access and stay up to date with important information, dates and activities. This solution will improve organization and reduce the risk of students continuing to have this problem. However, we face limitations such as compliance with privacy regulations, launching within a certain time frame, and managing the budget for its development and maintenance.


## Pruebas
En esta segunda fase igualmente realizamos nuestro formato de entrevistas y la aplicamos a (xs número) donde pudimos determinar algunos resultados mediante a las respuestas que nos dio la comunidad estudiantil ( a esta parte aún le falta ya que haga esta parte de la tarea) 

## Competencies
We have developed several key competencies in this second installment. Among the specific competencies, we highlight risk management, where we identify and reduce possible obstacles that may affect the project. In planning and organization, we structure tasks and resources efficiently, allowing a constant workflow. The technical knowledge acquired, such as handling GitHub and programming, has been crucial to advancing the platform. Effective communication has enabled smooth coordination between members and stakeholders, while problem solving has helped us overcome unforeseen challenges. In addition, we have applied quality control to ensure that deliverables meet established standards, and resource management has been vital to optimize the use of time, budget and equipment.

Regarding generic competencies, clear oral and written communication has been essential to keep us aligned during meetings, using Spanish to transmit instructions that were later reflected in the repository. The use of ICT has been essential for the project, using GitHub to store and collaborate on code, WhatsApp for continuous communication, StackEdit for text editing in Markdown, and Boardmix for the creation of use case diagrams. Finally, knowledge management has been key to organizing tasks, assigning priorities through previously scheduled meetings, which has ensured progress within the stipulated schedule.

## Farewell
To conclude, we want to thank everyone for their time and attention, see you in the next phase
