- ``E2.2|Audio Edition:`` The audio edition that will be used for the presentation of the video was generated, this was made up of 6 fragmented audios that were edited and later nested to be used as a single audio, this had noise elimination editing as well as adaptability to low noise , so as not to be heard, in some fragments the tone of the voice was raised or lowered due to the difference in these so that they are coherent aurally, one more part still needs to be added, which will be done in the next few days, the duration of this audio So far it is 4 minutes and 15 seconds and it is expected to be updated soon.  
**Time lapsed: 00:26:49**
