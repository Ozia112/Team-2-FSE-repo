## Welcome
Hello again, we are back for the continuity of “Uadyhub”, now we are entering phase 2 where we will continue developing our platform and improving its functionality. with the same organization and effort as always

## Introduction
The objective of our “Uadyhub” project is to make it easier for students to manage the various academic platforms offered by the faculty, helping them organize their activities more efficiently. We seek the product to integrate at least two university platforms into one, allowing users to easily access and stay up to date with important information, dates and activities. This solution will improve organization and reduce the risk of students continuing to have this problem. However, we face limitations such as compliance with privacy regulations, launching within a certain time frame, and managing the budget for its development and maintenance.

## Evidence
In this phase of our project, we focused on evaluating functionality and user experience through various interface prototypes. We started from 15 functional requirements and, after a series of reviews, we eliminated 7 to keep the 8 best. These prototypes were carefully designed taking into account the most important functional and non-functional requirements for students.

We sought to ensure that students could access all their academic platforms from one place. For example, we implement authentication with institutional email to ensure secure and exclusive access, the user must enter their email and password and then press login to access, as well as a button to translate into other languages, at the other end is the icon of our profile, at the bottom we can see the icon of the little house which is our main page where all the courses appear, next to it is the configuration button where you can edit your happy preferences next to it is the notifications icon so that users can Stay on top of your important tasks and updates.

In addition, the prototypes included options such as an advanced search bar and a clear display of the enrolled courses, next to it is the blue button icon that serves to accommodate your courses, which facilitates navigation and allows users to quickly find what they are looking for. they search. On the visual side, we ensure an attractive and adaptive design, as well as consistency and visual accessibility to offer an optimal experience on any device.
To validate the interface prototypes, we conducted four interviews with real users. We asked them to answer a series of questions by visualizing the interfaces and give us their opinion. The results were positive, as users found the platform useful and attractive and managed to identify key functions without difficulty. Thanks to this feedback, we adjusted specific details and confirmed that our design met the essential requirements and improved the usability of the UADY HUB platform.

## Process
This was the process we carried out for this second phase:
Task management and charts: We use visual tools to manage and monitor team tasks. This includes backlog boards, tasks in progress, and fulfillment timelines. Each team member was assigned clear tasks with defined deadlines to ensure structured progress.
New task list: We created a task list for this phase of the project, where each activity had start and delivery dates. This allowed for more efficient control of work.
Security protocols: In this phase, we implement new security protocols to protect the integrity of the platform and user data. This section will include a detailed explanation of the measures taken and how they address the security issues found in the previous phase.
Project registration and meetings: Links were provided to the project log, where we keep detailed track of the progress of each task. Additionally, an explanation of our regular meetings was included, in which we established work schedules to ensure that the project progressed smoothly.

## Farewell
To conclude, we want to thank everyone for their time and attention, see you in the next phase
