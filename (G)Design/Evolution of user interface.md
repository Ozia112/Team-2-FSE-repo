# Evolution of user interface 

For this third installment we worked on the interfaces with figma, since it was easy to use. In figma we can create interactive prototypes without code. It contains very important elements that allowed us to improve all the interfaces. You have the option to choose between many elements that it offers so that everything contributes to making the interfaces better.

For the evolution of the interfaces, a check box was added to the login interface to keep the session open or closed. Basically, it is the only noticeable change that the log in presents, since we kept the elements that we had put in the second sketch.

 With this, we move on to the interfaces within the app. Significant changes are observed with respect to our old prototype. In the new design, the search bar is presented with a selector that allows you to alternate between “Courses” and “Platforms”, giving a more direct option to filter information. The header of the interface shows a minimalist design with a leopard print background and the word “UADY HUB” in the center, while in the old design a similar header appears, but includes an additional description that says: “Find your courses faster!”. The new prototype also organizes courses as individual cards with details such as the instructor’s name, platform, and an indication of pending notifications represented by a number next to a colorful icon, whereas the old prototype groups available platforms more generally, without dividing courses directly. The new design has removed platform-specific notifications that were displayed in the old design. The new prototype also introduces a simplified design to the bottom navigation icons (notifications, home, and add), removing options such as mail and settings that were present in the old design. In the old design, additional descriptions appear below each platform that briefly explain its function, something that is omitted in the new prototype, favoring a cleaner, more direct approach. This shows an evolution toward a more functionality-focused and less text-heavy design.
 
  There were no changes to the notification interfaces, we continue to manage them in the same way and these were some of the components that we improved compared to the old interfaces

For the process of choosing the new changes that were made, we had meetings where we got together as a team to give our opinion on what could be improved so that it looks more comfortable to the eye, that it is better described, so that you don't have to struggle to find information, we asked some people what they thought about the new ideas that we had and what they thought were good ideas.


# Tools

**Stage One:** Initial Sketches 

In this initial phase, we used *Canva* to create the first sketches of the interface. The intention was to clearly define the structure and organization, providing a solid foundation on which to develop the detailed design.

**Stage Two:** Creation of Simulations

We chose *Penpot* as our first tool to begin creating interface simulations. However, while working with Penpot, we realized that it was not feasible to continue using this tool because the results did not meet our expectations.

**Stage Three:** Final Design

Finally, we turned to *Figma* as the last option for interface development. *Figma* proved to be the right tool, allowing us to meet all the necessary requirements in terms of resources and elements within the application.
