# Evolution of user interface 
(G2.0)


# Tools

**Stage One:** Initial Sketches 

In this initial phase, we used *Canva* to create the first sketches of the interface. The intention was to clearly define the structure and organization, providing a solid foundation on which to develop the detailed design.

**Stage Two:** Creation of Simulations

We chose *Penpot* as our first tool to begin creating interface simulations. However, while working with Penpot, we realized that it was not feasible to continue using this tool because the results did not meet our expectations.

**Stage Three:** Final Design

Finally, we turned to *Figma* as the last option for interface development. *Figma* proved to be the right tool, allowing us to meet all the necessary requirements in terms of resources and elements within the application.
