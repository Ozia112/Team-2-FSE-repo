## Sketches of interface requirements
- In this section, the prototype of the project was developed, which includes a simulation of the login process, 
as well as the conceptualization of a proposal to integrate various virtual platforms.

## Interface Evolution
### First sketch
- The first sketch of the interface was made in Canva, as it is an easy-to-use application and contains very good elements to create the designs.
