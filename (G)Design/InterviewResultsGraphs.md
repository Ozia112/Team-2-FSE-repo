# Interview Results Graphs

#### This table shows the results of the people interviewed, indicating the average score for each question. Thanks to this table, we identified that the question “Would you like to practice other languages on the platform?” has an average score of 5, which helps us see that this is an area that needs to be reviewed and, if necessary, corrected in the prototype.
