### **Protocol for Simulation Testing**

The purpose of this interview is to evaluate your opinion by analyzing the UadyHub application interface prototype. This application aims to facilitate students' access to their courses, notifications, and other academic resources. We will have you complete a series of tasks as well as some questions about the functionality of the interface prototype, in order to collect data for documentation.

- Your performance is not judged, but rather the functionality of the simulation.

### Tester data:
- Name
- Sex (male/female)
- Age
- Nationality
- Disability
- Language

#### **Tasks to be performed**:
