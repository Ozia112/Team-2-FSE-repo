## Justification of the scenario

The scenario was designed based on the most feasible functionalities within the time and resource constraints available at this stage of the project. Although some options are disabled, the scenario allows us to meet the application's objectives and guarantee a good experience for users.
The scenario allows us to demonstrate the functionality of the system and obtain data necessary for project documentation.
for usability testing. Despite the limitations, it manages to meet the proposed objectives within the timeframes and resources available.

## Usability

Usability aims to measure how easy it is for users to complete a specific task with the interface simulation provided. This will allow us to identify areas for improvement in the user experience, optimizing aspects such as navigation, interface clarity, and efficiency in performing tasks.

Through metrics such as the number of touches required to complete specific tasks. Additionally, this assessment will provide valuable information on potential friction points in the flow of use helping to improve for future changes and documenting information for the project, helping us prioritize changes or adjustments to the iteration.
