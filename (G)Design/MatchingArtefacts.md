### Verification of Requirements for Interface Proposal

Taking into account the functional requirements, defined in user stories along with their corresponding acceptance criteria and use cases, 
it is possible to determine if these features are sufficient by verifying them through a method. In this case, 
a **prototype** is proposed. By interacting with the simulation, the user validates whether the functional requirements are properly covered. 
Below is the link to the proposed prototype for demonstration and validation.
