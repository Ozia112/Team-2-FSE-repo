# Especific competences #

### 1. Evolution of Software Engineering
- Competence: Analyze the disciplinary evolution and characteristics of the linked professional.

  We consider this point if we reach it with the help of the teacher throughout the semester who stressed to us what software engineering is according to the IEEE, what the industry is like these days, how it works, what they are looking for, what to do. Throughout it also helped us know how to organize the project from scratch and helped us reflect that work in our project.

### 2. Software Development Areas

- Competence: Analyze methods, techniques and practices for the development phases (requirements, design, coding, testing and maintenance).

  If this point is met since with the creation of the project from scratch we were able to structure the entire development cycle, we use the agile method (scrum), in this delivery we refine our functional and non-functional requirements into the most important ones from our perspective, we organize the sprints to have short work cycles and specific goals, the final interface prototypes were made, which were a series of steps to follow, validating that its functionality was correct, the surveys and interviews also helped us to validate the prototype and see that the functional requirements are acceptable and non-functional

### 3. Software Life Cycle Models

- Competence: Select an appropriate model based on the team, client and problem.

  In our project, we used the Waterfall model to guarantee an orderly and controlled process from start to delivery, we considered the advantages and disadvantages of each model in relation to the client's needs and the resources we had in the team, we evaluated the skills techniques and experience of the members to determine the viability of the models, so we determined the waterfall model since we had a clear scope, to analyze the problem we obtained information through surveys, interviews and meetings, to organize the work we used guthub where we had specific departments where we had We had to upload the tasks depending on what they were, we constantly gave feedback on what we were missing, how we were doing with the interfaces that were tested and had the approval of the users


### 4. Software Management Areas

- Competence: Analyze methods and practices in estimation, planning, control and quality.

  This point is met since we had divided the delivery into sprints that allowed us to do the tasks on certain dates, we had the backlog to see the monitoring of the tasks and we had our metrics to follow the delivery time of the tasks, we used guthub and figma to manage our changes made in this delivery, any type of modification that there was, just as for each task each department head gave the go-ahead to upload the task or if there was something to modify

### 5. Human Factors in Software Engineering

- Competence: Identify the human factors that affect the success or failure of the processes.

  We had this competence in our project, the members had the willingness to help, collaborate actively, there was always constant communication, we adapted to the changes that had to be made, there was leadership at work, in the same way we also had activities extra school that sometimes made us leave before the meetings, perhaps work on his part at night, situations that arise unforeseen, we have a good leader who took his role very well, he motivated us to continue to give the last, everything the work It bore fruit when testing the product with users who had very positive reactions, very satisfied with the product, all the work that was carried out during these three phases can be said to have culminated in the best possible way.
