## Constructive criticism of the course

At the beginning of the course, we felt a little terrified since we were just entering and the first day our only class was in this subject where we met Professor Edgar Cambranes. Being the first class we all felt somewhat down with the speech that the professor gave. , which was not in a bad way, but rather talking to us about our reality and with our feet on the ground, obviously being the first day it was not what we expected and we believed that the teacher would be a tough person since in the following sessions started to ask us the definition of software engineering in our words to which we were afraid to answer for fear that our concept was wrong, but the truth is that he is a great teacher, because he always does not speak the truth, he is a teacher who likes what he does and we consider that it is good that it is hard because we have to fight and make an effort so that things turn out well for us, he explained the topics to us and asked us questions to know that we are paying attention and understanding, there were sessions where he told us anecdotes, experiences, brought students from semesters 
advanced to give us talks, there were sessions that were a little different and we did other activities, just as sometimes he gave us exams without telling us which is still good because we as students should always be prepared, we consider that he teaches his subject very well, he is a teacher who helped us a lot in this first semester, we learned many new things and also external things on our own, we learned to use tools that we did not know before and everything is positive, he also started making calls to us to see progress of our project and he gave us feedback, to close we want to say He is not the typical teacher who always teaches the same way, he makes his class very fun, he tries new things, he varies his classes and we think it was quite good, he is a teacher who wants to see his students grow and the vibe that he has is good. transmit to his students.
