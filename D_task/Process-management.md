# Process Management
## Introduction
The management of the project its a crucial role in lifecycle of any product, to be completed without or the less possible problems at the end. Throughout this document, 
the charts and tools used for managing the tasks completed by the project team members will be presented, including examples of ToDo-Doing-Done boards and timeline schedules.
A new task list for the project, with start and delivery dates, will also be available. 
Additionally, the new security protocols we have implemented will be explained in the section covering issues encountered. 
Links to the project log and an explanation of the team’s meeting and work schedules will be provided to ensure smooth progress on the project.

Lastly, a section will outline the final tasks expected from the team.

## Project section(github)
### Intructions in the Project Section
To ensure the proper use of the project section on GitHub, 
I will explain how to use it correctly. 
Keep in mind that the GitHub section serves primarily as a visual guide for the activities that need to be completed for the project.

- The main page of the project will appear in your screen if you click in the five option in the main tabs of GitHub.
![Project main page](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/TM-01-Branch/assets/Stage2/Process(D)/main_page_github_project.png "This is what the main page of the project section looks like")
  - In here you will see too many views option but first we will focus on the to do list section.
#
![Add Item Button](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/TM-01-Branch/assets/Stage2/Process(D)/main_page_github_project(add_item).png "In this button you will create a task")
#
![Click in the item name](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/TM-01-Branch/assets/Stage2/Process(D)/main_page_github_project(click_item).png "Click in the name of the item")
#
- Every task needs to be added for each member of the team, adding the following information:
![Item menu](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/TM-01-Branch/assets/Stage2/Process(D)/main_page_github_project(menu_item).png "This is the item menu and there shows the fields information that need to be filled")
  - Task priority
  - Task weight
  - Start date(**established in the schedule**)
  - End date(**established in the schedule**)
  - Assign your GitHub user to the task
And that would be it for the project section on github.
## [Milanote board][Milanote]
In Milanote, we will graphically manage the images used in the project, 
and we will also be able to create checklists to facilitate the individual management of micro-tasks or large tasks, 
as well as the correction of errors that occur during weekly iterations.

#
In milanote will discuss concepts desings for the UX/UI and the adition of diferents resources in the repo.

## Tasks Assignation
### Timeline Schedule Stage 2
Throughout the project, various tasks will be carried out and scheduled for delivery, with the final deadline set for October 22. However, this does not apply to all 
tasks. Below is a timeline with the tasks and their respective start and end dates:

#
### Task List
#### Product (B)
- B1.0 Product Evolution
  - Explain the changes made in the project, the differences between the first and second deliveries. Evidence must be inserted in the document.
#### Requirements (C)
- C1.0 Requirements Evolution
  - C1.1 All functional requirements are specified, along with a more detailed description of the user needs and the limits of what we can offer.
  - C1.2 All non-functional requirements are specified, defining the parameters needed to concretely establish the requirements.
#### Design (G)
- G1.0 Interface Sketches
  - G1.1 Sketches are created by hand or digitally as proposals for the project’s interface requirements.
  - G1.2 Each interface proposal is linked to its corresponding project requirement through the established format (Markdown).
- G2.0 Interface Validation
  > Collecting feedback from potential users
  - G2.1 Create an interview format that meets the parameters and validates non-functional requirements (high contrast, interface agility, user experience).
  - G2.2 Conduct interviews with potential users and record their responses.
  - G2.3 Create charts and evaluation tables that correctly present the interview results.
- G3.0 Create a simulation of three functional project requirements that are interactive (preferably the main ones).
  - G3.1 Develop and link simulation tests with the feedback collection activity.
  - G3.2 Create charts to validate the simulation.
#### Process (D)
- D1.0 Process Description
  - Describe and include evidence of the sprints, sprint sizes, planning, activities, their responsible parties, roles, and results.
- D2.0 Process Management
  - Include the tools used for project management (GitHub, Milanote, WhatsApp, Discord).
- D3.0 Process Metrics
  - D3.1 Include time measurement metrics for project execution.
  - D3.2 Include the division of tasks and their weight in relation to the entire project.
  - D3.3 Organization of the repository.
#### Presentation (E)
- E1.0 Script Development
  - Create a script that can successfully guide the creation of the video from scratch, specifying scene changes, video pacing, timing for inserting graphic materials, and the necessary dialogue for the explanation (check the video parameters).
- E2.0 Video Recordings
  - E2.1 Record the necessary scenes and audio for the video as indicated by the script to assemble them later.
  - E2.2 Edit the recorded audio to ensure cohesion in tone, volume, and video pacing.
- E3.0 Video Editing
  - The culmination of all audiovisual materials into a video explaining the product according to the established parameters, with a runtime of approximately 5:00 minutes, with a minimum variance of 20 seconds.
#### Competencies (F)
- F1.0 Update generic competencies.
- F2.0 Update specific competencies.
