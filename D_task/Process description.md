# Process Description (FIS Project Stage 1)
## Introduction
Hello Team 2 in this repo we will work on our project proposal for FIS in the coming months. 
We will start with stage 1, which includes the creation of the project documentation in the GitHub group repo and the production of a documentary video of a minimum duration of 5 minutes. For the correct functioning of the team, below I will explain the functions of each member, the weight of their tasks and the protocol to follow to comply in a timely manner with the final objective of the project (stage 1)
## Tasks to be completed:
The tasks to be completed are diverse and are distributed in five main branches that are Product, Requirements, Process, Presentation, Competencies. All these tasks are assigned an identification code to lighten the assignment processes that we will see later in the document. The codes are as follows:
### Categories
**A**: This refers to the overall project and is assigned to the entire team by default.

**B**: Refers to the category of: **Product**

`	`**BA1**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Objective**

`		`**BA1.1**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Problem Statement**

`	`**BA2**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Users/Customers**

`	`**BA3**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Value Proposition**

**C**: Refers to the category of: **Requirements**

`	`**CA1**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Functional requirements**.

`	`**CA2**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Non-functional requirements**.

`	`**CA3**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Priority Levels**

`	`**CA4**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Use Case Diagram**

`	`**FA2**: Refers to the subcategory called: **Specifics.**
 
Task Assignment and Weight
The tasks will be divided according to the weight of the tasks that has been assigned depending on their complexity and the calculation of the duration of the task.
Weight and Allowance
The weights are categorized into three types : Low, Medium and High, which to facilitate the measurement of the distribution, numerical values will be assigned to each category, as follows:

`Low`: 1

`Medium`: 2

`Height`: 3

The weight relationship with the tasks is as follows:

![Task Asignation by weights](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/FIS-Project-Stage-1/assets/task_assignation_by%20weights.png "Task Assignation")
### ID’s Assignation.
The assignment of Identifiers for team members will be implemented to increase the flexibility of team job changes in case a member is absent or previously assigned roles change in the next stages of the project. The enumeration is assigned in order of integration into the team at the time it was formed. At some point in the process, members may change their identifier with prior notice in case it is needed due to an emergency.
The assignment with team members (09/21/2024) is as follows:
- `TM-01`: Isaac Ortiz
- `TM-02`: Paola Parra
- `TM-03`: Rolando Cabrera
- `TM-04`: Álvaro Pantoja
- `TM-05`: Cristofer Barrera
- `TM-06`: Adrián Rosado
- `TM-07`: Alexander Castañeda
## Schedule
The tasks assigned to the members can begin to be carried out from tomorrow (09/22/2024) except for categories E and F that have to wait for at least categories B and C to be completed. While D begins to be prepared from day one (09/21/2024) due to administrative reasons of the project.
The schedule would be as follows:
![Schedule Graph](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/FIS-Project-Stage-1/assets/schedule_graph_stage_1v1.2.png "Schedule program")
The schedule is open to changes, the processes may take longer than established, so five days of margin is left in case of inconveniences with the previously established schedule.
## Workflow
### Protocols 
The work protocols will be managed in brief iterations that will be reviewed every two to three days, except in emergency cases where immediate intervention is required for a specific task.
### Meetings 
Meetings will take place at the faculty on Tuesdays and Fridays, where we will focus on making rapid progress on the project through constant communication and group clarification of any doubts. On Mondays and Thursdays, short meetings of less than an hour will be held to review progress and provide feedback, enabling timely corrections to errors or missing content in the assigned tasks.
### Logs 
It is necessary to maintain a log to document the team's work process and analyze its effectiveness. This task will be conducted by TM-03, and in the event of their absence from meetings, they will be temporarily replaced by TM-07.
### Repository changes
Once progress has been made on the work in the repository, a commit should be made, and the change should be applied to the main branch of the corresponding project stage (FIS-Project-Stage-1) through the creation of a pull request, where the changes to be implemented can be reviewed.
Each day, before starting the assigned activities, the team member must create a pull request to copy the files from the main project branch into their personal branch to work with the updated files and avoid accidental overwriting or duplication of unwanted files.
Below are the steps to follow to create the mentioned pull requests:
##

> Make a comparision between the two branches to create a copy
### Rules and acceptable nomenclatures for the repository
  -	Team members must keep their personal branches organized and clean, with their corresponding files placed in their assigned folders for images and task categories.
  -	Images should always be saved in the folder named assets, and they must have descriptive names in English to ensure image references in markdown files are well-structured.
  -	Branches should follow a naming structure consisting of the team member’s ID followed by the word Branch to be easily identified in the branch list.
   -	Folder creation for categories must include the corresponding category letter followed by the word "task," with an underscore instead of a space. Example: C_task. This is to facilitate directory management within Git code spaces.
   -	Each folder must contain a README.md file, serving as an explanatory text of the folder and its table of contents to allow for smoother navigation for the reader.
   - File names must always be written in English. If the task was originally written in Spanish, this should be specified next to the file name with “(esp)” beside the file version. The final file must be entirely in English, and it does not need to specify the language as it is assumed to be in English.
### Workflow protocol
The workflow follows simple Git protocols for faster work, so no other person is needed to confirm changes to the main branch. All changes must be stored in different files for modular management, as outlined in the following diagram:
![Flujo de trbajo](https://github.com/Ozia112/Team-2-FSE-repo/blob/FIS-Project-Stage-1/assets/work_flow_graph.png)
### Branch Creation
To be able to work in an orderly manner on the project, the creation of personal branches for each team member is completely necessary. The creation of these branches must follow rules and protocols so that order is maintained in the course of the work.
#### Rules:
>    - Branch names should be composed of the team member’s ID followed by the word “Branch”. Example: TM-01-Branch
>    - The source Branch for the personal Branch it must be the main branch of the project stage (FIS-Project-Stage-1)
>    - In your Branch you need to create a directory for your work with the main category of your task followed by the word “_task”, for example if your task assigned is BA1.1 you need to create a directory named as B_task
>    - The usage of assets like images need to be upload in the folder named “assets”
## Disclaimer
The redundancy of some rules and protocols in this file is justified by the need for clarity in the rules established at a general project level as well as specifically for the main branches.
