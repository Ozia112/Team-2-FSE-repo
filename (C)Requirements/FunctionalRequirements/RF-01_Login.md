## Prototype Comparison: Login Interface Design

### 1. **Initial Prototype (Left)**
The first prototype of the login interface was developed with a simple approach, considering only the following elements:

- **Text fields**: For entering username and password.  
- **Basic design**: Focused on minimal functionality.  
- **Direct login**: Without additional options to personalize the user experience.

### 2. **Improved Prototype (Right)**
The second prototype incorporated several enhancements to optimize the user experience:

- **"Keep me signed in" option**: A *check box* was added to allow users to stay logged in without re-entering their credentials.  
- **Interactive interface**: It included a design that allows users to have the experience of writing their information more smoothly and personally.

### 3. **Key Differences**
- The first prototype focused on basic functionality and a simple design.  
- The second prototype improved usability by adding new options that enhance user convenience and promote a more personalized experience.

These modifications reflect progress in understanding user needs and developing practical solutions to improve interaction with the interface.
