- ``(C1.0) Requirements Evolution|`` In the process of evolving the requirements, both functional and non-functional requirements were reduced to simplify the scope and improve development feasibility. Functional requirements were reduced from 8 to 3, combining and eliminating key elements. Non-functional requirements were consolidated into broader categories, such as "Visual Consistency and Accessibility" and "Ease of Use," removing those deemed non-essential. This optimization ensures a more focused and efficient development process.
